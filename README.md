# Rock Paper Scissors

## Description

A simple rock paper scissors game located at [pephanrockpaperscissors.netlify.app](https://pephanrockpaperscissors.netlify.app/). Created for a frontendmentor.io challenge where the assets are provided but you are allowed to implement the design in any way you wish. For this challenge I chose the technologies listed below. The file structure is inspired by Atomic Design but it does not implement every possible tier in the specification due to project size.

## Technologies

- React
- TailwindCSS
- HTML

## Installation

Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/peterphan20/frontend-rock-paper-scissors.git`

Move into repository

`cd frontend-rock-paper-scissors`

Install dependencies

`npm install`

## Usage

The user has the option to choose from one of the following three choices to play against the computer. If the user decides they want a challenge, they can click on the easy mode button to enable advance mode which increases the number of choices from three to five.
